# Bike Sharing

**Note:**
I worked with Aman Gill for this challenge. We followed pair-programming methodology and the code and readme was co-created.


##**Project Overview**

Tableau is a powerful data analytics tool that provides easy to understand dashboards for non-technical and technical viewers alike. Tableau visualizations provide analysts a way to tell a clear story and easily share the story with the audiance.

In this project, we will use New York cityBike data to help create a business proposal for a potential bike sharing company.

###**Checkout Times for Users**
Nearly all bikes are checked out for less than an hour at a time, with most rides lasting about 5 minutes.

###**Trips by Weekday for Each Hour**
Rides tend to increase during weekday commuting hours (6am-9am and 4pm-7pm), and midday during weekends.

##**Summary**
NYC Bike data shows us that target audience is Male and most bikes should be available before and after office hours. Locations near offices and business will be busiest.

Additional analysis can be performed to see:

Trip duration from each locations
Count of trips by age

A majority of users are male, and most of the trips last short duration.

Peak riding hours are typically during workweek commuting hours and midday during the weekends when riders are more likely to be riding for leisure.
Though the map will look different for Des Moines, we can see from the map of starting locations, that most bikes are checked out in more highly populated areas like downtown or near tourist attractions.
Based on these findings, the bike app for Des Moines should:

-   Focus on marketing to male riders and offering incentives for subscription.
-   More bikes and docking stations should be placed near downtown areas, office buildings, and tourist attractions since CitiBike in New York appears to be used   primarily for commuting and/or sightseeing.

##**Recommended Additional Visualizations:**

1.  A comparison of the number of trips bewteen different months to understand how ridership changes seasonally.
2.  Trips by weekday by age group
